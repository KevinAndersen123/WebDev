Suggested approach:

1. create new database, user-id, and password.

2. decide on how mant tables and how they relate to each other.

3. design your tables (schema) to conform to 1-N-F where appropriate.

4. work out the SQL needed to add to the tables, and then get data back out again.

5. design the screens/UI that you think you'll need - wireframe.

6. create Python code which does #4 (aka data_utils.py module from Guessing Game).

7. create the HTML templates that we need.

8. tie it all together with Python/Flask code.

Questions:  How do you identify your users?  Are you going to require users to login?
